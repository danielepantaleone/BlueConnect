    /// This method attempts to establish a connection to the given `BlePeripheral` using the provided options and within the specified timeout period.
    /// If the peripheral is already connected, the method will succeed immediately. If a timeout is specified and the connection is not established within
    /// that period, an error will be thrown.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - peripheral: The `BlePeripheral` to connect to.
    ///   - options: An optional dictionary of connection options. Defaults to `nil`.
    ///   - timeout: The maximum amount of time to wait for the connection. Defaults to `.never`, meaning no timeout.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The method returns asynchronously when the connection is successfully established or an error occurs.
    /// - Throws: An error if the connection fails or if the operation times out.
