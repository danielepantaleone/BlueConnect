/// A protocol defining the interaction with a BLE characteristic having read capabilities.
///
/// This protocol provides the essential properties and methods needed to interact with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) characteristic.
/// It requires that conforming types define a specific `ValueType` for the characteristic, and provide access to the UUIDs of the characteristic and its associated service.
///
/// Additionally, it allows access to the `BlePeripheralProxy` managing the peripheral.

    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - data: The data received from the characteristic. This is expected to be in a format that can be converted to the proxy's value type.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The decoded value of type `ValueType`, which represents the converted data.
