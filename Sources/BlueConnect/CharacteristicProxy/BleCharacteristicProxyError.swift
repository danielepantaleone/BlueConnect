/// and includes the underlying cause of the error.

    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - characteristicUUID: The UUID of the characteristic for which decoding failed.

    /// This error occurs when the raw data received from the characteristic cannot be decoded into the format expected by the proxy.
