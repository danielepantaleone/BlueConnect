/// A protocol defining the interaction with a BLE characteristic.

/// This protocol provides the essential properties and methods needed to interact with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) characteristic.
/// It requires that conforming types define a specific `ValueType` for the characteristic, and provide access to the UUIDs of the characteristic and its associated service.
///
/// Additionally, it allows access to the `BlePeripheralProxy` managing the peripheral.
