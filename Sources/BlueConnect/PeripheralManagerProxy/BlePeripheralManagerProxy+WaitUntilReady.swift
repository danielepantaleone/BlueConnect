    ///
    /// This method registers a callback that is invoked when the peripheral manager's state changes to `.poweredOn`, or an error occurs.
    /// The method also verifies that the peripheral manager is authorized and supported.
    /// If the peripheral manager is already `.poweredOn`, the callback is invoked immediately with success.
    ///
    /// Example usage:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// blePeripheralManagerProxy.waitUntilReady(timeout: .seconds(10)) { result in
    ///     switch result {
    ///         case .success:
    ///             print("Peripheral manager is ready")
    ///         case .failure(let error):

    ///   - timeout: The maximum time to wait for the peripheral manager to become ready. Default is `.never`.
