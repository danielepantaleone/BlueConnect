extension BlePeripheralManagerProxy {
    
    /// Waits asynchronously until the peripheral manager is in the `.poweredOn` state, or throws an error if the state is unauthorized or unsupported.
    ///
    /// This method uses an async/await pattern to wait for the peripheral manager to become ready. It checks the peripheral manager's state and resumes
    /// with success if it is already `.poweredOn`. Otherwise, it waits until the state changes to `.poweredOn` within the specified timeout.
    /// If the state is unauthorized or unsupported, it throws an error.
    ///
    /// Example usage:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// do {
    ///     try await peripheralManagerProxy.waitUntilReady(timeout: .seconds(5))
    ///     // Peripheral manager is ready
    /// } catch {
    ///     // Handle error (e.g., unsupported or unauthorized state)
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - timeout: The maximum duration to wait for the peripheral manager to be ready. The default value is `.never`, indicating no timeout.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The method returns asynchronously when the peripheral manager is ready or an error occurs.
    /// - Throws: An error if the it's not possible to wait for the peripheral manager to be ready within the provided timeout.
