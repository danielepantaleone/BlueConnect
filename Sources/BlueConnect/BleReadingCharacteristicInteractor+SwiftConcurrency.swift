public extension BleReadingCharacteristicInteractor {
    
    /// Read the characteristic value according to the provided cache policy.
    ///
    /// This asynchronous method first ensures that the characteristic is discovered.
    /// Once discovered, it reads the characteristic's value based on the specified cache policy.
    /// If the value is cached, it is returned from the cache; otherwise, the method reads it from the BLE peripheral.
    /// The method returns the value decoded into the interactor's `ValueType`.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - policy: The cache policy determining whether the value should be read from the peripheral or retrieved from the cache. Defaults to `.never`, which means that the value is always read directly from the peripheral.
    ///   - timeout: The duration to wait for the characteristic read operation to complete. Defaults to 10 seconds.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The characteristic value decoded into the interactor's `ValueType`.
    /// - Throws: An error if the characteristic cannot be discovered or read within the specified timeout, or if decoding the data fails.
