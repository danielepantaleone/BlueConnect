    /// bleCentralManagerProxy.connect(peripheral: peripheral, timeout: .seconds(10)) { result in
    ///     switch result {
    ///         case .success:

    ///   - peripheral: The `BlePeripheral` to connect to.
    ///   - options: A dictionary of options to customize the connection behavior, such as `CBConnectPeripheralOptionNotifyOnConnectionKey`. Defaults to `nil`.
    ///   - timeout: A `DispatchTimeInterval` specifying how long to wait before considering the connection as failed due to timeout. Defaults to `.never`, meaning no timeout.
    ///   - callback: A closure called with a `Result<Void, Error>` indicating the success or failure of the connection attempt. If the connection is successful, `.success(())` is passed. If it fails, `.failure(Error)` is passed with an appropriate error.
    ///
    /// - Note: If the peripheral is already in a `.connected` state, the callback is immediately invoked with success.
