extension BleCentralManagerProxy {
    
    /// Waits until the central manager reaches the `.poweredOn` state, executing the callback upon success or failure.
    ///
    /// This method registers a callback that is invoked when the central manager becomes ready (i.e., transitions to the `.poweredOn` state),
    /// or when an error occurs due to an unsupported or unauthorized state, or a timeout.
    /// If the central manager is already `.poweredOn`, the callback is invoked immediately with success.
    ///
    /// Example usage:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// bleCentralManagerProxy.waitUntilReady(timeout: .seconds(10)) { result in
    ///     switch result {
    ///     case .success:
    ///         print("Central manager is ready")
    ///     case .failure(let error):
    ///         print("Central manager is not ready: \(error)")
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - timeout: The maximum duration to wait for the central manager to become ready. The default is `.never`, meaning no timeout.
    ///   - callback: A closure that receives a `Result` indicating either success, or failure if the central manager is unauthorized, unsupported, or if the timeout is exceeded.
