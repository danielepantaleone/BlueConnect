    /// do {
    ///     try await bleCentralManagerProxy.connect(peripheral: peripheral, timeout: .seconds(10))
    /// } catch {

    ///   - options: A dictionary of options to customize the connection behavior, such as `CBConnectPeripheralOptionNotifyOnConnectionKey`. Defaults to `nil`.
    ///   - timeout: A `DispatchTimeInterval` specifying how long to wait before considering the connection as failed due to timeout. Defaults to `.never`, meaning no timeout.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The method returns asynchronously when the connection is successfully established or an error occurs.
    /// - Throws: An error if the connection fails or if the operation times out.
