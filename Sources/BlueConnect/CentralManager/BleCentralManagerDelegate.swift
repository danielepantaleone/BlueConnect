import CoreBluetooth

/// A protocol defining the delegate methods for handling Bluetooth Central Manager events.
///
/// The `BleCentralManagerDelegate` protocol extends `CBCentralManagerDelegate` and provides additional
/// methods for handling central manager updates, connections, discoveries, disconnections, and failures.
///
/// This protocol is typically implemented by objects that need to receive events from a `BleCentralManager`, which wraps CoreBluetooth's `CBCentralManager`.
public protocol BleCentralManagerDelegate: NSObject, CBCentralManagerDelegate {
    
    /// Called when the Bluetooth central manager updates its state.
    ///
    /// This method informs the delegate about any state changes of the Bluetooth central manager, such as
    /// becoming powered on, off, or unsupported.
    ///
    /// - Parameter central: The central manager whose state has been updated.
    func bleCentralManagerDidUpdateState(_ central: BleCentralManager)
    
    /// Called when a connection is successfully established with a peripheral.
    ///
    /// This method notifies the delegate that the central manager has successfully connected to the specified peripheral.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - central: The central manager managing the connection.
    ///   - peripheral: The peripheral to which the central has connected.
    func bleCentralManager(_ central: BleCentralManager, didConnect peripheral: BlePeripheral)
    
    /// Called when a peripheral is discovered during scanning.

    /// This method notifies the delegate when the central manager discovers a peripheral advertising nearby.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - central: The central manager conducting the scan.
    ///   - peripheral: The discovered peripheral.
    ///   - advertisementData: A `BleAdvertisementData` object containing advertisement data from the peripheral.
    ///   - RSSI: The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of the discovered peripheral.

    /// This method notifies the delegate when the central manager has disconnected from a peripheral, either
    /// intentionally or due to an error.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - central: The central manager managing the disconnection.
    ///   - peripheral: The peripheral that has been disconnected.
    ///   - error: An optional error object if the disconnection was due to an error, or `nil` if the disconnection was intentional.

    ///   - central: The central manager attempting the connection.
    ///   - peripheral: The peripheral that the central failed to connect to.
    ///   - error: An error object describing the reason for the connection failure.

    ///
    /// This method notifies the delegate that the central manager will restore its state, typically when the app
    /// has been relaunched by the system to continue managing peripherals.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - central: The central manager that is restoring its state.
    ///   - dict: A dictionary containing the preserved state information for the central manager.
