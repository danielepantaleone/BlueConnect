import CoreBluetooth

/// A protocol extending `CBPeripheralDelegate` to provide additional functionality for unit testing BLE peripherals.
///
/// The purpose of `BlePeripheralDelegate` is to mock BLE peripheral operations, enabling tests for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interactions without needing real hardware.
///
/// By conforming to `BlePeripheralDelegate`, objects can simulate a BLE peripheral's behavior, allowing controlled testing of peripheral operations such as reading and writing
/// characteristics, discovering services, and handling updates to RSSI and characteristics. This protocol includes methods corresponding to BLE operations that occur during
/// communication with a peripheral.
///
/// Conforms to: `CBPeripheralDelegate`
///
