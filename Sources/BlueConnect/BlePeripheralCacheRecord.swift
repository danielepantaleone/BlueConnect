import Foundation

/// A struct that holds the value read from a `BlePeripheral`, cached locally to reduce communication with the Bluetooth hardware device.
///
/// The cached data can be reused according to the provided `BlePeripheralCachePolicy`, avoiding unnecessary BLE communication for data that doesn't change frequently over time.
/// This struct stores both the cached data and the time when it was cached, allowing for cache expiration logic based on time intervals.
///
/// - Note: This is useful for optimizing performance and reducing BLE interactions when retrieving static or infrequently changing data.
public struct BlePeripheralCacheRecord {
    
    /// The data cached from the BLE peripheral.
    public let data: Data
    /// The time when the data was cached. This helps in determining whether the cache is still valid based on `BlePeripheralCachePolicy`.

    ///   - data: The data to be cached.
